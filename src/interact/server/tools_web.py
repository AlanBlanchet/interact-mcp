    """Execute a sequence of actions on a browser session or desktop window.

    TARGET — the `target` param picks ONE surface:
    - A web page (the common case): leave `target` unset (or "browser"); actions run on browser
      session "default" (or the named `session`). This is the default for all web automation.
    - A NATIVE desktop app (not a web page — e.g. a terminal, editor, Electron/GTK/Qt window):
      set `target=<window title substring>`. Call list_desktop_windows FIRST to discover titles.
    - The whole desktop: `target="screen"` (all monitors combined) or `target="screen:<index>"`
      for one monitor (list_desktop_windows shows the monitor indexes).
    A desktop `target` and a non-default `session` are mutually exclusive. For a website, leave
    `target` unset.

    TARGETING a click/type_text/hover/drag/scroll — any of: `ref` (browser, from
    get_interactive_elements / get_page_state / screenshot — unique, survives re-renders),
    `element` index (desktop), `selector` (CSS), `name`(+`role`) (accessible name), or `x`,`y`
    coordinates. Use whichever fits; a `ref` avoids the "N elements match" ambiguity a bare
    name/selector can hit. A scroll's anchor picks WHICH widget receives the wheel (the one
    under the pointer) — anchor it on the scrollable area (unanchored = window center on
    desktop, current pointer in the browser).

    Each action needs a 'type' key to select the action model.

    Mutating: click, double_click, type_text, scroll, drag, navigate, evaluate_js, upload_file, key_press, click_element, resize
      - type_text with NO ref/selector types into whatever is focused — after a click on a field,
        just type; you don't need to name the field twice.
      - `wait` accepts a duration on ANY action ("3", "8s", "1500ms", "1m"), a load state
        ("networkidle"/"load"/"domcontentloaded"), or a CSS selector to wait for.
      - click: `button` picks which mouse button — "left" (default), "right", or "middle". A
        right-click is the ONLY way to open a context menu gated on Qt.RightButton / contextmenu;
        works on both desktop and browser targets.
      - resize (DESKTOP/nested only): set the window to an exact width+height after launch — check
        a layout at a narrower size without relaunching. Browser targets use emulate_device instead.
      - double_click: select a word / fire a dblclick (browser; two clicks don't coalesce).
      - select_text (browser): make a real DOM text selection in an element — for a selection-gated
        control like a Lexical inline toolbar (drag dispatches drag-and-drop, not a selection).
    Observations: screenshot, wait_for, http_request, hover, annotate
    Dialogs: handle_dialog — arm how the NEXT native JS dialog (confirm/alert/prompt) is answered:
      {"type":"handle_dialog","action":"accept"|"dismiss","prompt_text":"..."} placed BEFORE the
      step that triggers it (one-shot). Unarmed dialogs are dismissed (a confirm()-gated click
      then no-ops) — every dialog is reported in the step output with its message.
    Tab control: new_tab, switch_tab, close_tab
    Media: emulate_device also forces CSS media features — `reduced_motion:"reduce"` (verify a
      site's `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` branch live), `color_scheme:"dark"`,
      `forced_colors:"active"`; `"null"` clears one. They can be set ALONE (no viewport needed,
      no page reload) and persist across new tabs and viewport changes.
    Viewport: emulate_device — set the session to a device profile (a Playwright `device` name like
      "iPhone 13", or explicit width+height (+ device_scale_factor/is_mobile/has_touch), or
      reset=true) to verify responsive/mobile layouts at true device metrics. Run it before
      navigating; the return value of an evaluate_js step is surfaced JSON-serialised as that step's
      output (use `return <expr>` or an arrow that returns).
    Timing: sleep — a FIXED pause (max 30s). Use ONLY for genuine fixed delays (e.g. an
      animation). To wait on something concrete, do NOT sleep-and-guess: attach `wait` to the
      preceding action, or add a `wait_for` step — both block exactly until the condition holds.
    Comparison: compare — VLM comparison of snapshots from earlier steps (by 1-based index).

    Browser-only actions (navigate, evaluate_js, wait_for, upload_file, new_tab, switch_tab, close_tab, emulate_device, double_click, select_text) error when used with a desktop target.

    Any action can include 'wait' to wait after execution (networkidle, load, domcontentloaded, or a CSS selector — browser only).
    wait_for blocks until a `selector` reaches a state OR a `text` substring appears — prefer it over `sleep` for content/navigation.
      With NEITHER selector nor text it is simply a pause of `timeout` ms, and that bare form works
      on a desktop target too (the selector/text forms are browser-only).
    Any action can include 'observe' (a VLM query string) to capture a screenshot after execution and analyze it. The snapshot is stored by step index for later compare actions.

    scope: CSS selector to restrict the final capture to a page sub-tree (browser only).
    wait: after all actions, wait for a condition (browser only).
    query: when set, returns vision analysis of the final state (or, with record, of the recording).
    record: when True, capture one frame per step and have a video model read them in order — so
        it understands what each action produced (the flow), not just the end state. Works on
        browser and desktop targets, on the live session (no context reset). Cost is bounded: the
        frames are sampled to config.video_max_frames, so a short interaction keeps every step and
        a long one is evenly down-sampled.
    debug_dir: when set, dump inputs/outputs/screenshots to this directory for debugging.
