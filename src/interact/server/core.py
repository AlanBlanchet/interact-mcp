"""Core of the ``interact`` MCP server package: the shared ``FastMCP`` instance every tool
registers on, the server lifespan, the tool-facing instructions, the browser
:class:`SessionRegistry`, and the small dependency-free helpers (path/mime/label formatting)
that every other submodule leans on.

The package is split by COHESION — ``vlm`` / ``sandbox`` / ``targets`` / ``capture`` hold the
private helpers, ``tools_*`` hold the ``@mcp.tool`` surfaces — so no single file is a 2000-line
monolith. ``server/__init__`` re-exports the whole public + test-patched surface, so both
``import interact.server as srv; srv._vlm`` and ``from interact.server import _scan_elements``
keep resolving. Cross-module calls to a monkeypatched helper are MODULE-QUALIFIED
(``vlm._vlm(...)``, ``targets._resolve_target(...)``) so a test patching that helper on its home
module is seen at the call site; same-module calls stay bare.
