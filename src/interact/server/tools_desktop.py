    """Launch an app in interact's isolated sandbox display and drive it there.

    The sandbox is a clean, WM-less X display the agent owns — non-intrusive (it never touches the
    user's real windows, cursor, or focus) and occlusion-proof. Use it when a window must be driven
    reliably regardless of what the user is doing, or when a GPU/desktop app won't screen-grab on
    the real desktop. After launching, drive it with the normal tools using target="nested:<title>"
    (one window) or target="nested" (the whole sandbox screen): screenshot, run_actions, etc.

    Sizing the display: the default is 1280x800 (desktop-shaped). A MOBILE/phone app laid out for
    portrait looks wrong there — pass device="phone" (or "tablet"/"desktop") for a correctly-shaped
    screen, or size="WxH" (e.g. "412x915") for an exact resolution. The launched window is fitted to
    fill the display. Changing the size respawns the shared sandbox (any other app in it is dropped).

    Scrolling a FLUTTER surface: use `scroll` (the wheel), not `drag`. Flutter's default
    ScrollBehavior excludes the mouse from `dragDevices` on desktop, so a mouse DRAG on a
    scrollable (a ListView, a DraggableScrollableSheet) is ignored by the framework itself — a
    real mouse behaves the same way, so this is not something automation can work around. `drag`
    is still right for reordering, sliders, and canvas gestures.

    Transient popups — menus, Qt/QComboBox drop-downs, tooltips — open as SEPARATE override-redirect
    windows that a single-window capture (target="nested:<title>") doesn't include; capture the whole
    sandbox screen (target="nested") to see/act on them, or drive the widget by keyboard (arrows +
    Enter). A blurred bar (Flutter BackdropFilter) can render as a black strip under software GL —
    reach its controls via in-app routing or run on a real GPU.

    command: the command to run (e.g. "xterm", "flutter run -d linux", a built binary's path).
        Shell syntax works too — "cd /my/proj && uv run app" runs via bash — but prefer `cwd=`
        for a project directory (a plain command keeps the launch rewrites, e.g. Flutter's
        software-GL flag, which shell commands bypass).
    wait: seconds to wait for a window to appear before returning.
    size: nested display resolution as "WxH" (overrides device + the default).
    device: a display shape — "phone" (412x915), "tablet" (820x1180), or "desktop" (1280x800).
    cwd: working directory to launch in (so "uv run app" finds the project without a cd).
    replace: stop whatever was launched into the sandbox before starting this app (the default).
        The sandbox is shared, so relaunching used to ADD an instance rather than replace one:
        several live copies of the same app accumulated and captures composited a stray widget
        from an older instance over the current window. Pass replace=False to run two apps side
        by side on one display.
