"""Input actions, grouped into a package.

``models`` holds the typed action definitions (the ``AnyAction`` union + each ``*Action`` pydantic
model, plus ``BROWSER_ONLY_ACTIONS`` / ``DESKTOP_ONLY_ACTIONS`` and the JS-wrapping helpers); ``dispatch`` executes a sequence
of them against a browser session or a desktop window. This ``__init__`` re-exports the action
models (so ``from interact.actions import AnyAction`` resolves) and the two dispatch entry points.
